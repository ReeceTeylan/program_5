#Create a Simple App Calculator

# Integrate tkinter to the code
# The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations
# The application will ask the user for two numbers
# Display the result
# The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not
# If yes, repeat Step 1
# If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 
# Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime
